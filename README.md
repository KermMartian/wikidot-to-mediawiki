Wikidot to Mediawiki convertor
====================
A simple script for migrating from Wikidot to Mediawiki. Doesn't support everything but should make
your life a little easier ;)

How to use
--------------------
`convert.py -f INPUT_FILE -o OUTPUT_FOLDER`

This will create a file called with the same name as the input file in the output folder.
